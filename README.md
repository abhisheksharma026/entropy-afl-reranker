## Entropy-AFL Reranker: Entropy-Regularized Focal Filtering and Calibrated Reranking for Rare Event Classification

This repository implements a three-stage modular architecture for rare-event classification, focused on high recall, precision, and calibrated probability estimates.
The pipeline is specifically designed for highly imbalanced datasets (e.g., loan delinquency, fraud detection).

### Our method combines:

- Entropy-Regularized Asymmetric Focal Loss (ER-AFL): Improving recall while maintaining calibrated predictions.
- Confidence-Guided Reranking via Calibrated XGBoost: Precision refinement over high-confidence samples.
- Meta-Calibrated Fusion: Final ensemble improving both recall and precision with enhanced calibration.

### Features
- Custom PyTorch implementation of Entropy-Regularized Asymmetric Focal Loss (ER-AFL)
- Confidence-thresholded reranking based on calibrated outputs
- Meta-calibrated ensemble fusion using XGBoost
- K-Fold Cross-Validation + Holdout Evaluation
- Full calibration analysis (ECE, Precision-Recall curves)
- Designed for Credit Card Fraud Detection and Lending Club Loan Delinquency datasets
